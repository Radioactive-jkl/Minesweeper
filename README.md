## Highlights

* Original taste and flavour - UI style.
* Modern C++ with QT5.14.2
* Easy to read my code even no comments.
* Simply download the
  [boxed_exe](https://github.com/Radioactive-jkl/Minesweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper_boxed.exe)
  and start using.



## Usage

1. Download the 
   [boxed_exe](https://github.com/Radioactive-jkl/Minesweeper/blob/master/MineSweeper_boxed.exe)
   then use.
    
3. Use an IDE like **Qt Creator** to develop [*`QTcode`*](https://github.com/Radioactive-jkl/Minesweeper/tree/master/QTcode).



## Development


**`QTcode`** is recommended to use Qt Creator.


### Using the command line

On Linux and macOS, you can compile and run the tests using the command line from the project's root directory.


### Using an IDE that supports CMake

1. Load the project directory in your IDE.
2. In the build settings for CMake, which can usually be found at
   `Settings > Build > CMake`, set the `Generation path` to `build`.

Then you can simply select which target (unit test) you want to build/run, and
your IDE will do the rest.

In case your IDE does not support CMake directly, you will need to run `cmake`
via the command line with the appropriate flags to generate the project files
for your IDE. Give it a try, it's not supposed to be hard!

If using Qt Creator
Just download[*`Qtcode`*](https://github.com/Radioactive-jkl/Minesweeper/tree/master/QTcode)
and open **`MineSweeper.pro`** to use.
